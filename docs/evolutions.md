Evolutions
Evolve xenomorphs into advanced roles using royal jelly and other resources to strengthen your hive and unlock critical gameplay functionalities (e.g., jelly production, defense roles, hunting improvements). Each evolution pathway continues to add depth and progression to your hive, creating unique builds based on your hive type and strategy.

Evolution Mechanics
1. **Pathways**:  
   Each xenomorph evolves through its pathway using specific hosts, resources, and sometimes **conditions** (e.g., hive type requirements, unlock milestones). Evolution is critical for creating Queens, hybrid xenomorphs, and hive-specific roles.  

2. **Resources Required**:  
   - Royal Jelly: The primary resource for all evolution processes.  
   - Pathogen Spores/Motes: Special consumables for mutation pathways.  
   - Evolution Stabilizers: Optional consumables to reduce failure rates on difficult evolutions.  

3. **Evolutions and Roles**:  
   - Xenomorph roles (e.g., Worker, Defender, Hunter) are tied directly to evolutions, making these pathways critical for hive functionality.  
   - Evolving a xenomorph into a Queen unlocks royal jelly production.  

4. **Chance of Success/Failure**:  
   - Some advanced evolutions include a risk of failure, returning weaker xeno results. Stabilization consumables can mitigate this, but risk-reward makes jelly resource management critical.

Example Commands
/evolve [xenomorph_id] – Start the evolution process for the specified xeno.

/evolve list – View all housed xenomorphs, showing "evolving" xenos and their progress.  

/evolve cancel [xenomorph_id] – Cancel an ongoing evolution (resources will not be refunded).  

/evolve info [xeno_id] – Display details for evolution pathways available for that xeno.

/evolve queue – Enables scheduling multiple evolutions (queue spots depend on hive upgrades).  

Core Xenomorph Pathways
Standard Evolution Paths
- Human Pathway
    - Normal Egg → Human Host → Facehugger → Chestburster → Drone → Warrior → Praetorian → Queen → Pathogen Runner  
- Dog Host Pathway
    - Normal Egg → Dog Host → Facehugger → Chestburster → Drone → Sentry → Crusher → Queen  

Elite Xenomorph Pathways
These pathways involve **rare eggs** or **rare hosts**, making them more difficult to acquire. They unlock powerful xenomorphs, each with unique stats or mechanics tied to hive needs.  

- **King Pathway**:  
  Pathway exclusive to **King Egg**:  
  - King Egg → Human Host → King Facehugger → King Chestburster → Knight → Grand Duke → Prince → King → Emperor → War King  

- **Deacon Pathway** (Mutation Pathway):  
  Requires **rare evolutionary conditions**:  
  - Deacon Egg → Hammerpede → Trilobite → Engineer Host → Deacon  

- **Neomorph Pathway**:  
  - Neomorph Egg → Mote Spores → Human Host → Bloodburster → Neomorph

#### **Hybrid Evolutions and Variant Pathways**  
Certain evolution paths split into variations depending on hive specialization, rare hosts, or consumables used during evolution (e.g., **Mutation Stabilizers**, **Pathogen Liquid**). These evolve into hybrids or variant roles.  

- **Mutated Pathways**:  
  - **Queen → Pathogen Runner**: Hive changes role into Pathogen Hive following this evolution.  
  - **Queen → Empress**: Focuses on jelly production (bonuses to survivability and output).  
  - **Queen → Queen Mother**: Unique evolution for large-capacity milestones (produces elite hybrid-ready eggs).  

- **Hybrid Breeds (Possible Additions)**:  
  - Predalien: Predator Host → Hybrid Chestburster → Drone → Warrior → Predalien  
  - Space Jockey Xenomorph: Jockey Host → Rare Chestburster → Drone → Spitter → Elite Jockey Xeno

#### **Additional Xenomorph Variant Suggestions**  
These optional pathways expand the diversity of your hive, adding replayability and variety:  
- **Protomorph**: No host required. Grows from **Proto Egg**. Strong general stats.  
- **Spitter**: Aggressive projectile variant focused on ranged defense and attacks.  
- **Prowler**: Designed for faster and stealth-based hunting roles. High agility but low durability.

### **Requirements for Evolving Xenomorphs**  
#### Example Requirements:
1. **Drone → Warrior**:  
   - Requires: 10 Jelly  
   - Time: 1 Hour  

2. **Praetorian → Queen**:  
   - Requires: 50 Jelly  
   - Time: 3 Hours  

3. **Queen → Pathogen Runner**:  
   - Requires: Pathogen Liquid + 100 Jelly  
   - Time: 6 Hours  
   - Effect: Deletes your hive and resets production to prepare for Pathogen Hive setup.

### **Progression Mechanics for Evolution**
1. **Unlock Milestones through Evolution**:  
   As players evolve xenomorphs, milestones reward elite consumables, rare eggs, or unlocked hybrid branches:  
   - First Queen Evolution: Unlocks jelly production.  
   - Evolve 10 xenomorphs: Unlock Egg Mutation Chambers.  
   - Evolve Pathogen Runner: Unlock Pathogen Hive.  

2. **Evolution Queue System (Upgrade)**:  
   By upgrading their hive, players can unlock the ability to queue multiple xenomorphs for evolution:  
   - Upgrade Level 1: 1 Evolution Slot.  
   - Upgrade Level 2: 2 Slots.

### **Challenges and Balancing in Evolution**  
1. **Success/Fatality Rates**:  
   - Rare paths (e.g., Pathogen Runners, Predaliens) introduce small failure chances, where xenomorphs lose stat boosts or revert to Drone level.
